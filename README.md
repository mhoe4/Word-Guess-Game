## Young Thug Themed - Word Guess Game 

 Use the letter character keys to try to guess the name of the Young Thug Song that is represented by the hyphens on the left side of the page!

 When you guess the name of the song correctly, it will begin playing in the area on the right side of the page where the name of the song will be displayed. You will then try to guess the name of a new song.

 The song playing when the page is loaded is not the song you are trying to guess.
 
 Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

 If you fail to guess the name of the song in the allowed number of letter guesses, a new song will be displayed for you to guess.

 The length of the word or words you are guessing is designated by '-'s on the left hand side of the page (under the area that says wins).

 As you guess correct letters, the '-'s are revealed like the game hangman.

   * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

 The number of guesses remaining is in yellow below the word you are guessing.

 The incorrect letters you have guessed are at the bottom in red. You cannot accidentally guess the same letter twice.

 There are buttons on the right side of the page (above the album art for the song playing) that can be used to Play/Pause the audio.
